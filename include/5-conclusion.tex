\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We establish a large-scale dataset for bottles detection in UAV images which we call UAV-BD. In contrast to general object detection benchmarks, we annotate a huge number of well-distributed bottles with oriented bounding boxes. We also establish a benchmark for bottle detection in UAV-BD and show the feasibility to produce oriented bounding boxes by modifying a oriented bounding box based detection algorithm.
