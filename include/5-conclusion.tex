\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we build a large-scale dataset for bottle detection in UAV images, i.e.,UAV-BD. In contrast to general object detection benchmarks, we annotate a huge number of well-distributed bottles with oriented bounding boxes. We believe this dataset is challenging and very useful for real vision based bottle recycling. Based on this dataset, we also establish a benchmark for bottle detection and show the feasibility to produce oriented bounding boxes by modifying an oriented bounding box based detection algorithm.
