\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we have built a large-scale dataset for bottle detection in UAV images, i.e., UAV-BD. In contrast to general object detection benchmarks, we annotate a huge number of well-distributed bottles with oriented bounding boxes. We believe this dataset is challenging and very useful for real vision based bottle recycling. Based on this dataset, we also establish a benchmark for bottle detection and show the feasibility to produce oriented bounding boxes which provide more useful information for bottle grasping.

In future work, we will focus on locating and recycling bottles in the real-world using UAV.
