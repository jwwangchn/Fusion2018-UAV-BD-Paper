    This paper proposed a vision based system used in UAV for bottle detection. In UAV's perspective, bottles has huge variation in scale, ratios orientation and shape. Traditional annotation methods use the horizontal bounding box to annotate the objects, but we use the method of  oriented bounding box which is easier to separate the objects from background. It is worth mentioning that we have collected \boldmath $ 25,407 $ images of bottles with size of \boldmath $ 342\times 342 $ pixels using UAV in the different scenes. These bottles are in a wide variety of scales, ratios, orientations and shapes. And we also have annotated these images using oriented bounding box. These fully annotated images contain  \boldmath $ 34,791 $ instances, each of which is annotated by an arbitrary \boldmath $\{c_x, c_y, h, w, \theta \}$ quadrilateral. To build a baseline for bottle detection, we evaluate some state-of-the-art object detection algorithms like  Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv2 and RRPN on our UAV-Bottle Dataset (UAV-BD). Experiments demonstrate that our dataset contributes to environmental protection applications and are quite challenging due to the difficulties of locating the multi-angle bottles and separating them effectively from the background.
