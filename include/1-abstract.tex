    This paper proposed a vision based system, that is used in UAV for bottle detection. In UAV's perspective, the bottle has huge variation in scale, orientation and shape. Traditional annotation methods use the horizontal bounding box to annotate the objects, but we use the oriented bounding box. To this end, we collect \boldmath $ 25,407 $ bottle images which size is \boldmath $ 342\times 342 $ pixels from UAV in the different scene. These images contain bottles exhibiting a wide variety of scales, ratios, orientations and shapes. These UAV-Bottle images are then annotated using oriented bounding box. The fully annotated UAV-Bottle images contain  \boldmath $ 34,791 $ instances, each of which is annotated by an arbitrary \boldmath $\{c_x, c_y, h, w, \theta \}$ quadrilateral. To build a baseline for bottle detection, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on UAV-Bottle Dataset, which include Faster R-CNN, SSD, RRPN. Experiments demonstrate that UAV-Bottle well represents environment applications are quite challenging due to the difficulties of locating the multi-angle bottles and separating them effectively from the background.
