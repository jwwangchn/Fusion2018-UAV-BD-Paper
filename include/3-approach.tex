\subsection{Dataset collection}
\label{ssec:image_collection}

%As mentioned in former section, we analyzed the challenges of bottle detection in UAV images.

For dataset collection, we follow four key suggestions: (1) collecting images with bottles of a wide range of scale and aspect ratios; (2) collecting images with bottles of different background scenes; (3) collecting images with bottles of different orientations; (4) collecting as many types of bottles as possible.

%\begin{itemize}
%% 1. 尺度问题
The UAV platform used in this work is DJI Phantom 4 Pro quadcopter integrated with a 3-axis stabilized gimbal. Images are collected by a camera mounted on the quadcopter. The resolution of the captured images are $ 5472\times 3078 $ pixels. In order to collect images covering bottles of a wide range of scales and aspect ratios, images at different flight altitudes ranging from $ 10m $ to $ 30m $ are collected.

%% 2. 背景复杂
In UAV images, the backgrounds of the bottles are very complex. To increase the diversity of dataset, we classify the possible scenes and divide them into eight scenes. Eight scenes are illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-original-image} and Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-cut-image}. In Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-original-image}, we show eight original images of eight scenes whose sizes are $ 5472\times 3078 $ pixels. In Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-cut-image}, we show the segmented images of eight scenes, each scene contains three images whose sizes are $ 342 \times 342 $ pixels. Eight background scenes are chosen and annotated in our UAV-BD, including \textit{Bush forest land}, \textit{Waste land}, \textit{Step}, \textit{Mixture}, \textit{Flat ground}, \textit{Plastic stadium}, \textit{Sand land} and \textit{Grassland} . The background scenes are selected according to whether a kind of scene is common and its value for real-world applications.

%%% 3. 瓶子旋转
%The bottles in UAV images often appear with arbitrary orientations. We find the orientation of bottles will affect the robustness of the trained model, so we annotate images by using the oriented bounding box.


%% 4. 瓶子透明
%The plastic bottles are usually transparent, so the background can be seen through the bottle, increasing the difficulty of detection. Our dataset includes a lot of examples of transparent bottles, so we can use this large dataset to train a robust model.


%\end{itemize}
%\begin{enumerate}[1. ]
%	%% 1. 尺度问题
%	\item The size of the bottles is very small, their sizes are generally less than $ 50\times 50 $ pixels. At the same time, due to the different altitudes of the UAV, their scales change very much. For solving this problem, we collect images at different flight altitudes of the UAV.
%	
%	%% 2. 背景复杂
%	\item In UAV images, the backgrounds of the bottles are very complex, resulting in poor performance of the general algorithm. In order to increase the diversity of dataset, we classify the possible scenes and divide them into eight scenes, each with a different number of images. Eight scenes are illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-original-image} and Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-cut-image}. In Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-original-image}, we show eight full images of eight scenes whose sizes are $ 5472\times 3078 $. In Fig.\ref{fig:dataset-cut-image}, we show the segmented images of eight scenes, each scene contains three images whose size are $ 342 \times 342 $.
%	
%	%% 3. 瓶子旋转
%	\item In contrast to conventional object detection datasets, the bottles in UAV images often appear with arbitrary orientations, depending on the perspective of the UAV camera. We find the orientation of bottles will affect the robustness of the trained model, so we annotated images by using the oriented bounding box.
%	
%	%% 4. 瓶子透明
%	\item The plastic bottles as rubbish are usually transparent, so the background can be seen from the bottle, increasing the difficulty of detection. Our dataset includes a lot of transparent bottles, so we can use this large dataset to train a robust model.

\subsection{Annotation method}
\label{ssec:annotation_method}

We build the UAV-BD for the bottle detection problem by collecting bottle images using UAV. In computer vision field, many visual concepts such as region descriptions, objects, attributes, and relationships, are annotated with horizontal bounding boxes, as show in \cite{DOTA, boundingbox}. A common description of horizontal bounding boxes is $(c_x, c_y, h, w)$ or $ (x_{min}, y_{min}, x_{max}, y_{max}) $, where $(c_x, c_y)$ is the center location of horizontal bounding box, $h, w$ are the height and width and $ (x_{min}, y_{min}) $ is the top left location, $ (x_{max}, y_{max}) $ is the bottom right location\cite{DOTA}. 

Objects with less orientations can be adequately annotated with this method. However, horizontal bounding box cannot accurately or compactly outline oriented instances such as the objects in UAV images. In UAV images, the overlap between two bounding boxes is sometimes very large that some state-of-the-art object detection methods cannot diffetentiate them\cite{DOTA}. At the same time, horizontal bounding box may contain lots of background pixels while annotating the object, especially when objects with large aspect ratios. 

An option for annotating oriented objects is using the method of arbitrary quadrilatral bounding boxes. This annotation method can be expressed as ${(x_i, y_i), i=1,2,3,4}$, where $(x_i, y_i)$ denotes the position of the oriented bounding boxes' vertices in the image\cite{DOTA}. The vertices are arranged in a clockwise order. But as bottles are rigid with almost no deformation, so we choose a method called $\theta$-based oriented bounding box, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:OBB}. This method is often used in text detection benchmarks, expressed as $(c_x, c_y, h, w, \theta)$ where $\theta$ is the angle from the horizontal direction of the horizontal bounding box\cite{DOTA}. The tool for annotating is roLabelImg\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cgvict/roLabelImg.git}}.

%% 3. 数据量统计 
\subsection{Dataset Statistics}
\label{ssec:Dataset_Statistics}
UAV images are usually very large in size compared to conventional image datasets. The size of original image in UAV-BD is $ 5472\times 3078 $ pixels, while most images in conventional datasets (e.g. PASCAL VOC and Microsoft COCO) are no more than $ 1000\times 1000 $ pixels \cite{RCNNforSmall}. To avoid segmenting the single instances (bottles) into different tiles, we firstly annotate on the original images without segmentation. But we find original image is too large to be trianed for CNN-based algorithms. So we segment each original image into $ 144 $ small tiles, and the size of tile is $ 342\times 342 $ pixels. Note that we abandon the instances at the border. Then we use these small tiles to train CNN-based detection model. 


The detailed statistics of the UAV-BD is shown in the Table\ref{statistics}, where $ n_1 $, $ n_2 $, $ n_3 $,  $ n_4 $ are the number of original images, small images, instances in original images, instances in small images for each scene, respectively. And UAV-BD contains about $ 34,791 $ object instances in $ 25,407 $ images. The ``Grassland" scene has the largest number of object instances: $ 7,795 $ instances in $ 5,785 $ images. The ``Step" scene has the smallest number of instances: $ 2106 $ instances in $ 1,325 $ images.

As bottles usually have rigid body, thus we can get some prior information to train the detection model. For example, we can use the distribution of angle, size and ratio as prior information to improve the performance of detection model. For UVA-BD, we plot the distribution of angle, size and ratio respectively, which are illustrated in Fig.\ref{distribution}. From Fig.\ref{angle}, we can see that bottles' angles in the dataset are almost uniform. And most of bottles' sizes are range from $500 $ pixels to $ 3000 $ pixels while the ratios of bottles are mostly range from $ 1.0 $ to $ 4.0 $, which are shown in Fig.\ref{size} and Fig.\ref{ratio1}. Note that we use these statistics data to design detection models.
